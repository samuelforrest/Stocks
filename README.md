This mini starter project provides inspiration for the foundational UI and design for my Computer Science NEA Stock Simulator App. I learnt about how to implement slick react native graphs into my application.

I followed this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1UkQuwY4bk&t=7553s

However, I stopped at 2 hours, at the API part, due to the fact that the API software has since changed signficantly, and I can no longer follow the tutorial.

TwelveData and IDM, however, I think may be good financial API sources to consider using in my final application. They offer free tiers, as well as a Â£29/month starter tier.
